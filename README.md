## Project Description

gFonts is a redesign and evolution of the Google Fonts website. Google Fonts is great but many users have some common fonts that they are fond of but there isn't currentlya way to go back to those fonts and use them in the future. gFonts rectifies that by letting users save their fonts to a database and come back for them later. It also makes the process of adding fonts to a project quicker by have one click to have the fonts appear to you rather then the cumbersome multi-step process of Google Fonts.
